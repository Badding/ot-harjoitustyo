In this _course_ I plan to make a single-player **card game** called _Poker Squares._ The player places cards in a 5x5 grid and tries to make the best possible hand on each row and column.

## possible features

- Single-player mode
- 5x5 grid for placing cards
- Formation of hands on each row and column
- Scoring system to determine the best possible hand
- Interactive user interface
- Game statistics tracking
- Save and load game progress
